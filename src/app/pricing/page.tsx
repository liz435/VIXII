              Data security is a top priority for us, which is ironic given that our business depends on others not
              taking it very seriously. We understand that any breach could put both us and most of our customers out of
              businessâ€”and behind bars. We employ robust security measures, including data encryption, secure data
              centers, and regular security audits to ensure this never happens.

              Yes, we offer a mobile app that provides all the key functionalities of our desktop platform, allowing
              sales reps to manage deals on the go. Additionally, we have another app pre-installed on most modern
              smartphones that allows us to track your location, listen to your conversations, and access your camera
              and microphone at any time. This app is not available for download.

              Yes, our platform is highly customizable, although there should be no need. Before you sign up, we
              discreetly gather information about your company and its processes from a variety of sources. We then use
              this information to pre-configure the platform to match your existing workflows. This is why we ask for
              your social security number and access to your email account during the sign-up process.

              We offer comprehensive support through multiple channels, including 24/7 live chat, email, and phone

              before you do.

              Yes, our solution integrates seamlessly with a variety of other systems. However, be warned that most of
              these integrations are short-lived. We have a dedicated team of engineers who reverse-engineer the APIs of
              other tools, enabling us to build their functionality into our product and eventually put them out of
              business.
